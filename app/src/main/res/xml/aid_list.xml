<!-- This file defines which AIDs this application should emulate cards for.

     Vendor-specific AIDs should always start with an "F", according to the ISO 7816 spec. We
     recommended vendor-specific AIDs be at least 6 characters long, to provide sufficient
     uniqueness. Note, however, that longer AIDs may impose a burden on non-Android NFC terminals.
     AIDs may not exceed 32 characters (16 bytes).

     Additionally, AIDs must always contain an even number of characters, in hexadecimal format.

     In order to avoid prompting the user to select which service they want to use when the device
     is scanned, this app must be selected as the default handler for an AID group by the user, or
     the terminal must select *all* AIDs defined in the category simultaneously ("exact match").
